# Convex + TypeScript + ESLint

This template provides a minimal setup to get Convex working, with TypeScript
and ESLint.

Start by editing `convex/myFunctions.ts` and interact with your backend from the
dashboard or via the CLI:

```sh
npx convex run myFunctions:myQuery '{"first": 1, "second": "Hello"}'
```

See Convex docs at https://docs.convex.dev/home

## Setting up

```
npm create convex@latest -t bare
```
